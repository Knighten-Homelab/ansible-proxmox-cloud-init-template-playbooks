# Homelab - Ansible Proxmox Cloud-Init Templates Playbooks

Ansible playbooks that generate cloud-init templates for Proxmox VMs. These are intended to be ran on the Proxmox host itself. For my use case, I manually launch these playbooks as needed from AWX.

## Cloud-Init Templates
* [Debian 12 (Bookworm)](debian-12)
* [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](ubuntu-22-04)
